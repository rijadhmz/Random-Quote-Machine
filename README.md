## Random Quote Machine

This project involves a React application that functions as a "Random Quote Machine." It was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp "Front End Development Libraries" course certification.

### Project Description

The Random Quote Machine is a web application built using React and Redux. The application generates and displays random quotes to the user, allowing them to discover and share inspiring quotes from various sources.

### Challenge Requirement

The challenge required building an app similar to [this example](https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/). The following user stories were fulfilled:

1. The app contains a wrapper element with the id "quote-box."
2. Within the wrapper, there are elements with the ids "text" and "author."
3. The "new-quote" button fetches and displays a new random quote.
4. The "tweet-quote" button allows users to share the current quote on Twitter.

### Implementation Details

The project leverages Redux to manage the application's state and provide seamless control over quote generation and display. A reducer handles the state updates, and the application's UI is crafted using React components.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Bootstrap (for styling)
- Font Awesome (for Twitter icon)
